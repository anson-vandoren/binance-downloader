# Contributing

If you have a suggestion, or find a bug, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/anson-vandoren/binance-downloader/issues).
If you have a solution, or want to implement some changes, feel free to fork the repo,
make your changes, and open a pull request. I will try to respond to PRs within a few days
when possible and either merge, or provide feedback.
